# DATX11-Bachelor-Project-Scripts
The Scripts for group 55's DATX11 Bachelor Project: Procedurally Generated Content in Games and its Effect on Player Experience. 

This repository contains the scripts of the game **Goblin Raider**, created to easily compare handmade levels with procedurally generated levels. The game is a simple dungeon crawler, where the player is a goblin robbing two castles for their gold. One of the castles feature 3 levels designed by us and the other 3 procedurally generated levels. For the procedurally generated levels, random walk was used in the first iteration, while in the second, graph rewriting was used.

The player's goal is to reach the end of each level by defeating enemies and solving simple puzzles. Players can move with **WASD**, attack using its weapon by **left-clicking** for a basic attack and **right-clicking** for the weapon's special attack. The player can also dash by pressing **LSHIFT** and interact with object like health potions and doors by pressing **E**. Loot chest can be found in each level with new weapons the player is able to use.

Under each iteration folder, the build, in the format of a zip file, can be found and downloaded. To play the game, unzip the file and start the ```DATX11Game.exe``` file.
